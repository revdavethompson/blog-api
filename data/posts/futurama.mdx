# You can't crush me but you can't crush my spirit!

I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. Look, last night was a mistake. WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! 

Of all the friends I've hadâ€¦ you're the first. I'll get my kit! Tell her she looks thin.

## I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!

Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. Why yes!

1. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets!
2. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.
3. You can see how I lived before I met you.
