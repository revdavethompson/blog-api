# In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.

Throw her in the brig. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life.

Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Fry! __Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!__ *Bender?!* You stole the atom.

## Fatal.

Guess again. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own!

1. Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?
2. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
3. That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?

### Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.

Take me to your leader! Why would a robot need to drink? What are their names? Who are you, my warranty?!

* We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
* And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.
* Bite my shiny metal ass.

No! The cat shelter's on to me. No, just a regular mistake. Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?

You lived before you met me?! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs?

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. No! Don't jump! I wish! It's a nickel.

I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Why not indeed! Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!

Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious.

Bender, quit destroying the universe! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Now what? Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.

Your best is an idiot! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. I'll get my kit! Tell them I hate them.

Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?

That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? Your best is an idiot! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!

Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.
